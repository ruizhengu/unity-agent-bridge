description: Do not prompt or auto-run git commit and push
---

When generating code, refactoring, or making any changes to the project files, you **MUST NOT** attempt to automatically run `git commit` or `git push`. 

The user prefers to manually review, commit, and push their changes themselves. You may still run `git status` or `git diff` if you need to analyze your changes, but never push.
