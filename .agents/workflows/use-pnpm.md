description: enforce pnpm for frontend package management
---

When working on any frontend web application or Node.js environment within the VoxelQA project (e.g., inside the `Dashboard` directory), you **MUST** use `pnpm` as the package manager instead of `npm` or `yarn`.

This includes:
- Running `pnpm install`
- Running scripts like `pnpm run dev` or `pnpm run build`
- Adding dependencies with `pnpm add <package>`
